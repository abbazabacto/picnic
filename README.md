# Picnic AngularJS Project

This is a project made for an assignment for Picnic.

To run the project, make sure you have NodeJS installed, and run:

```npm install && npm start```

The site will spawn a server which you can see at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

All the code is tested using Karma/Jasmine, when the server above running see the [coverage report](http://localhost:3000/coverage/html/src).
